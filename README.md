# TUF conformance test suite

This is the repository of the conformance test suite for TUF clients. The goal of this
repository is to allow client developers to
  1. test their clients against the TUF specification
  2. Achieve better practical compatibility with other implementations
  3. Collaborate on tests with other client developers

> [!NOTE]
> The conformance test suite is currently under rapid development. There is no stability guarantee
> on either the GitHub action inputs or the client-under-test CLI protocol yet. Please wait for
> initial release if that sounds unappealing.

## Usage

The conformance test suite provides a GitHub action that can be used to test a TUF client.
There are two required steps:

1. Include an executable in the client project that implements the client-under-test
   [CLI protocol](CLIENT-CLI.md).
2. Use the `theupdateframework/tuf-conformance` action in your test workflow:
    ```yaml
    jobs:
      tuf-conformance:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v4

          # insert possible client compilation/installation steps here

          - uses: theupdateframework/tuf-conformance@main
            with:
              entrypoint: path/to/my/test/executable
    ```


## Development

This repository contains two client-under-test CLI protocol implementations
to enable easy development and testing. The test suite depends on various
python modules which will be installed by the make commands into a virtual environment.
The suite also depends on `faketime` tool which needs to be available.

```bash
# run test suite against both included clients or just one of them:
make test-all
make test-python-tuf
make test-go-tuf
```

It's also possible to locally run the test suite with a client-under-test CLI that is locally installed elsewhere:

```bash
make dev
./env/bin/pytest tuf_conformance --entrypoint path/to/my/client-under-test/cli
```

linters can also be invoked with make:
```bash
# Run linters
make lint
# Fix issues that can be automatically fixed
make fix
```


### Creating (and debugging) tests

Let's say we want to test that clients will not accept a decreasing targets version. We start with a simple skeleton
test that doesn't assert anything but sets up a repository and runs client refresh against it:

```python
def test_targets_version(
    client: ClientRunner, server: SimulatorServer
) -> None:
    # Initialize our repository: modify targets version and make sure the version is included in snapshot
    init_data, repo = server.new_test(client.test_name)
    repo.targets.version = 7
    repo.update_snapshot()  # snapshot v2

    # initialize client-under-test, run refresh
    client.init_client(init_data)
    client.refresh(init_data)
```

we can now run the test:
```bash
./env/bin/pytest tuf_conformance \
    -k test_targets_version                 # run a specific test only
    --entrypoint "./clients/go-tuf/go-tuf"  # use the included go-tuf client as client-under-test
    --repository-dump-dir /tmp/test-repos   # dump repository contents

# take a look at the repository targets.json that got debug dumped
cat /tmp/test-repos/test_targets_version/refresh-1/targets.json
cat /tmp/test-repos/test_targets_version/refresh-1/snapshot.json
```

The metadata looks as expected (targets version is 7) so we can add a modification to the end of the test:

```python
    # Make an non-compliant change in repository
    repo.targets.version = 6
    repo.update_snapshot() # snapshot v3

    # refresh client again
    client.refresh(init_data)
```

Running the test again results in a second repository version being dumped (each client refresh leads to a dump): 
```bash
./env/bin/pytest tuf_conformance \
    -k test_targets_version                 # run a specific test only
    --entrypoint "./clients/go-tuf/go-tuf"  # use the included go-tuf client as client-under-test
    --repository-dump-dir /tmp/test-repos   # dump repository contents

# take a look at targets versions in both snapshot versions that got debug dumped
cat /tmp/test-repos/test_targets_version/refresh-1/snapshot.json
cat /tmp/test-repos/test_targets_version/refresh-2/snapshot.json
```

The repository metadata looks as expected (but not spec-compliant) so we can add some asserts for client behaviour now.
The final test looks like this:

```python
def test_targets_version(
    client: ClientRunner, server: SimulatorServer
) -> None:
    # Initialize our repository: modify targets version and make sure it's included in snapshot
    init_data, repo = server.new_test(client.test_name)
    repo.targets.version = 7
    repo.update_snapshot()  # snapshot v2

    # initialize client-under-test
    client.init_client(init_data)

    # Run refresh on client-under-test, expect success
    assert client.refresh(init_data) == 0

    # Make a non-compliant change in repository
    repo.targets.version = 6
    repo.update_snapshot() # snapshot v3

    # refresh client again, expect failure and refusal to accept snapshot and targets
    assert client.refresh(init_data) == 1
    assert client.version(Snapshot.type) == 2
    assert client.version(Targets.type) == 7
```


### Some design notes

* pytest is used as the test infrastructure, the client-under-test executable is given with `--entrypoint`
* A single web server is started. Individual tests can create a simulated TUF repository that will be served in 
  subdirectories of the web server 
* Each test sets up a simulated repository, attaches it to the server, runs the client-under-test
  against that repository. It can then modify the repository state and run the client-under-test again
* the idea is that a test can run the client multiple times while modifying the repository state. After each client
  execution the test can verify 
  1. client success/failure
  2. clients internal  metadata state (what it considers currently valid metadata) and
  3. that the requests client made were the expected ones
* There should be helpers to make these verifications simple in the tests
